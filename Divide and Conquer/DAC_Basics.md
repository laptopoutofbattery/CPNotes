# Divide and Conquer algorithmns
**Divide and Conquer** is a technique used to solve large problems by breaking the problem into smaller subproblems, solving these subproblems individually and combining them to get the desired output. Therefore, this technique is divided into 3 parts:
1. Divide: divide problem into smaller subproblems
2. Conquer: solve sub-problems by calling recursively until solved
3. Combine: combine the sub-problems to get the solution
