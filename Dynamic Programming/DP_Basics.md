# Dynamic Programming Basics
**Dynamic Programming** is an algorithmic paradigm that splits a complex problem into subproblems and stores answers of these subproblems to avoid computing these results again. It is an optimization over plain recursion, which reduces time complexity from exponential to polynomial. However, it increases space complexity (not a huge concern in competitive programming).  

Dynamic programming is used to efficiently solve problems with 2 main properties: **overlapping subproblems** and **optimal substructure**.
**Overlapping Subproblems Property**
Dynamic Programming combines solutions to sub-problems. When the same subproblems are repeatedly needed, dynamic programming is used.
